UX UI  |   15 days sprint   |   with Teresa Prosch


PROBLEM
This is the 2 weeks final project I worked on with my team mate Teresa Prosch as part of the Ironhack course.

We worked on Comyuno, a social network web app that connects people based on a specific location, a community or an event. Its stakeholder wants to focus on networking events and users find the interface of the app confusing to navigate plus the iOS users can't get notifications.

SOLUTION
We worked on a native iOS app for events. We re-designed the UI to make the app more intuitive for users and also to differentiate it from the competitors. We also integrated a matchmaking feature to make the networking in professional events less stressful for attendees.

My role in this project was to work all the way from the early stages of research of the design thinking process until fine-tuning the animations of the final deliverable, an interactive hi-fi prototype.

DESIGN PROCESS

PROTOTYPE

OUTCOME
This project was one of the three finalists of our UX/UI course and we presented it at the general public in the Hackshow held in Factory Berlin.

Our next steps would be to test and work on the accessibly of the app.
This was my first time working with Figma. It was a great tool for collaboration and for creating interactions quickly. For that reason, we could do multiple iterations on the hi-fi prototype.
